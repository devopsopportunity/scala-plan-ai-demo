**Scala-Plan-AI** is an advanced task planning and management application initially developed in **Scala** and later adapted into a simplified version in **Node.js + Vanilla JS**. The version we are presenting is an **MVP - (Minimum Viable Product)**, designed to showcase the core features, gather feedback, and guide future development.

### RFC 9512 - Official YAML Media Type  
Starting from February 14, 2024, RFC 9512 formally registered **application/yaml** as the media type for all YAML content, introducing **+yaml** as the standard structured syntax suffix.

### Key Features  
- **Intelligent Task Management**  
  - CRUD operations for tasks  
  - Smart task distribution (7:00 AM - 11:00 PM)  
  - Micro-scheduling in 15-minute blocks  
  - Toast notifications for user feedback  

- **Area Creation and Management**  
  - Each area represents a related group of tasks  
  - Add, modify, and remove tasks for each area  
  - In the future, areas will be linked to daily tasks to track progress  

- **Advanced Logging System**  
  - Viewing and managing task progress through an advanced logging system  
  - Smooth and customizable user interface  

### Roadmap (in Quarters)  

**- Q1 2025** - Migration and MVP Demo Online:
Migration from the Scala-based system to a simplified version with Node.js + Vanilla JS. The goal is to showcase a live demo with basic features, allowing intelligent task management and a clean, functional user interface. In this simplified version, data will be managed through browser localstorage, without persistence in a central database. This version is intended to demonstrate the concept and gather useful feedback for future development.

**- Q2 2025** - Area Management and Progress Monitoring:
Introduction of the area monitoring system, with the ability to link each area to daily tasks. Users will be able to view the progress of each area in real time.

**- Q3 2025** - Task Automation and Optimization:
Implementation of an advanced automation system for task management, with the ability to assign automatic priorities and deadlines to improve efficiency.

**- Q4 2025** - Artificial Intelligence for Monitoring and Productivity:
Development of artificial intelligence features to suggest optimized tasks based on daily progress and user habits, to maximize productivity.

**- Q5 2025** - Database Server Integration:
Adding data persistence through the integration of a database server to ensure that information is securely stored and no longer reliant on browser localstorage. Data can be synchronized, and users can be managed centrally.
