# Project Description

In the project I managed, I made extensive use of **CSS3**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, and **Scala PlayFramework**, integrating them coherently to achieve the Team's objectives.

## CSS3
I chose to work with advanced **CSS3** to optimize the user interface, implementing various innovative solutions.

### Layout and Structure
I utilized **grid-template-columns** to create dynamic and flexible layouts, combining it with **flex-wrap** for fluid element arrangement. Space management was optimized using the **gap** property, ensuring uniform and professional spacing.

### Animations and Transitions
I implemented complex animations using **keyframes** for particle effects, enriching the interface with smooth transitions. **Bezier curves** were fundamental in creating natural and pleasant movements. The **stroke-dasharray** property allowed me to define dashed line patterns in **SVG** shapes, for example, creating the effect of progressive circle completion to display completed tasks. This technique made the interface more dynamic and engaging.

### Transformations
The transformation system included using **transform** in its various forms: *scale* for hover effects, *translate* for precise element positioning, and *rotate* for managing image rotations. I also implemented smooth transitions for *opacity*, improving visual interaction.

### Responsive and Interactive UI
The responsive interface was created using the **@media** selector, while advanced selectors like **nth-child** enabled sophisticated menu management. Dynamic backgrounds with **linear-gradient** were implemented, and specific modifications were made to the **calendar-picker-indicator** for customized date selectors.

## JavaScript
On the frontend, I used **Vanilla JavaScript**, exploring the most modern features of the language.

### Modern Features
I extensively used **rest** and **spread** operators to manipulate arrays and objects. **Arrow functions** made the code more concise, while **MutationObserver** allowed efficient monitoring of *DOM* changes. I structured the code using static classes for better organization.

### Date and Data Management
Date manipulation was implemented using the **Date** object in a thread-safe manner, with special attention to formatting through **padStart**. Modern operators like **slice**, **map**, **join**, and **shift** were employed for array manipulation. File handling was optimized with **Blob** for **YAML** content, introducing support for new **MIME** types used in **AI** systems released in February 2024.  
Additionally, I implemented data *destructuring* in JavaScript to dynamically separate ongoing tasks from completed ones.

### Interactive UI
I developed a complete **drag-and-drop** system with advanced event management, implementing **toast** notifications and dynamic **popups** for **CRUD** operations. Style manipulation during drag-and-drop was managed through **window.getComputedStyle**, ensuring a smooth user experience. Integration of **dataTransfer.setData** maintained compatibility with native browser behaviors, enhancing user experience consistency.

#### Regular Expressions and Data Selection
I used **regular expressions (regex)** for validating user input, applying complex patterns to ensure information was correctly formatted. JavaScript **querySelector** was employed to select and manipulate DOM elements, enabling targeted operations such as dynamically modifying CSS classes, extracting attribute values, and implementing custom UI functionalities.

### Architecture
The system's architecture was built following established patterns with **init** and **constructor**, implementing a robust event management system through **attachListeners** and **handler**. Asynchronous calls were handled using **fetch**.

## Scala
I implemented the backend using **Scala PlayFramework**, configuring the environment through **build.sbt**, with particular attention to integrating **snakeyaml** for managing **YAML** files. The server logic was developed to ensure efficient and scalable data processing.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrated how the evolution of web technologies requires continuous professional growth. Integrating new concepts like **YAML** support for **AI** systems represented a stimulating challenge.
