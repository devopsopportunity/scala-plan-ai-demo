This guide provides step-by-step instructions for initializing and running your Scala-based project, along with additional guidance on installing Scala and its dependencies.

## Quick Start: Running the Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:
1. **Scala Installed**: Verify Scala is installed on your machine. If not, refer to the detailed installation guide below.
2. **SBT (Scala Build Tool)**: Installed and configured.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Project**:
   ```bash
   sbt run
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:9000/` by default.

4. **Optional: Development with Auto-Reload**:

# Detailed Installation and Setup

This section provides comprehensive steps for installing Scala, testing with a "Hello World" program, and exploring additional technical resources.

## Installing Scala

### Using SDKMAN (Recommended for Linux/MacOS):
1. **Install SDKMAN**:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
   source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
   ```

2. **Install Scala**:
   ```bash
   sdk install scala
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   scala -version
   ```

### Windows Installation:
- Use the [official Scala website](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/) to download and install Scala.
- Set up environment variables as per the instructions provided during installation.

## Testing Scala Installation
1. **Create a Simple "Hello World" Program**:
   - Create a file named `HelloWorld.scala`:
     ```scala
     object HelloWorld {
       def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
         println("Hello, World!")
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Compile and Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   scalac HelloWorld.scala
   scala HelloWorld
   ```

If the output is `Hello, World!`, your Scala installation is successful.

## Additional Technical Resources

### YAML Documentation and Standards
- The project utilizes YAML-based configuration files. Familiarize yourself with the YAML RFC 9512 standard for structured data exchange.
  [Read more about YAML RFC 9512](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/yaml-media-type-rfc/)

### SBT and Project Templates
- Learn more about SBT: [Scala Build Tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
- Generate new Scala projects using templates:
  ```bash
  sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8
  ```
